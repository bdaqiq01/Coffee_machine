# Coffee_machine

This script defines a CoffeeMachine class that simulates a simple coffee vending machine.
The class can optionally be initialized with specified amounts of water, coffee, and milk.
 It includes the following key features:

1. Ingredient Check: Ensures there are enough ingredients (water, coffee, and milk) to make a cup of coffee.
2. Make Coffee: Prompts the user to insert dollar bills and change.
 If sufficient funds are provided, it makes a cup of coffee, deducts the used ingredients, and returns any excess change.
  If funds are insufficient, it notifies the user.
3. if the user enters coffee close, or if it doesn't want another coffee the machine closes.

To run:
run the coffeeMachine.py script
